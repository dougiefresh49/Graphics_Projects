Spinning Triangle: readme
###############################################

Code Written and tested in:
---------------------------
Visual Studios 2010/ 2012

About:
--------------
- this project was to create a triangle that spins faster as the user moves the mouse 
	north on the screen and slower as the mouse is moved south.
- also the background color changes to a brighter color as the user moves the mouse to the left 
- the background color changes to a darker color as the user moves the mouse to the right
- the color of the background changes with selected keysyrokes
- the triangle can also be moved around by clicking and dragging the middle button of the mouse
- (all together the triangle can spin and be moved all the while the background color changes)


Key Strokes:
---------------
B		  Changes the background to Black/grey based colors
C         Changes the background to Cyan based colors
M 		  Changes the background to Magenta based colors
W 	      Changes the background to White based colors
Y		  Changes the background to Yellow based colors

To run the code: 
---------------------------
-Run the executable or import the project into Visual Studios

NOTE: The triangle will spin at a fast pace when the mouse is moved north but on some computers this does not happen for some reason.
