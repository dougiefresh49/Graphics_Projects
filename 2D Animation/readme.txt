Programming Assignment 6- 3-D Lamp
###################################

Testing Environment
---------------------
- Tested in Visual Studios 2010


How it Works
-------------------
- To watch the Lamp jump from the ground up onto the desk simply press the A key
- To switch to a lap with only 3 segments, press the K key.
- To see each of the key frames individually, press 1, 2, 3, or 4 for the desired fram.
- The frames are preset as I could not get part 1 working.
- I have everything that I can think of in the code so maybe a quick glance in the code for at least some partial credit if that is possible



Extra
----------------
- I added an extra arm, colors, and some design to the lamp.
- Also there is a desk drawn when the lmap is annimated
